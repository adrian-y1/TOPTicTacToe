# The Odin Project's Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a 2 player based game where players take turns to place their marker (Either X or O) in a square on the board. Players win by having 3 consecutive markers in a row, column or diagonal line.

In addition to the logical implementation of this project, tests are also written for the *Board* and *Player* class.
